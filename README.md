#Riichi Mahjong "Guide"

## Basic Hand Concepts

* **Yaku:** A scoring combination of tiles. Each yaku has a specific value (fan or han).
* **Dora:** Bonus tiles that increase the value of your hand.
* **Riichi:** A declaration that your hand is ready (tenpai) and you are aiming to win on your next draw. This also adds a yaku.
* **Furiten:** A rule that prevents you from winning by ron (discard) on a tile you have previously missed.
