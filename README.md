# Riichi Mahjong Hands and Difficulties

Riichi Mahjong, a popular Japanese variant of Mahjong, involves forming specific hand combinations (yaku) to win. Understanding these hands and their difficulties is crucial for strategic play.

## Basic Hand Concepts

* **Yaku (役):** A scoring combination of tiles. Each yaku has a specific value, measured in "fan" or "han." These combinations dictate the base points you receive for a winning hand. Multiple yaku can be combined to increase the total score.
* **Dora (ドラ):** Bonus tiles that increase the value of your hand. They don't form a yaku themselves, but each dora in your winning hand adds one fan to the score. Dora tiles are revealed after each deal and after each kan.
* **Riichi (立直):** A declaration that your hand is one tile away from completion (tenpai) and you are aiming to win on your next draw. This declaration costs 1000 points and adds a yaku to your hand. You cannot change your hand after declaring riichi.
* **Furiten (振聴):** A rule that prevents you from winning by ron (discard) on a tile you have previously missed. If you have discarded a tile that would have completed your hand, you cannot win by ron on that tile until your next draw.
* **Tenpai (聴牌):** The state of being one tile away from a winning hand.
* **Meld (鳴き):** Exposing tiles from your hand to form sets (pon, chii, kan). Open melds can limit your hand's potential yaku.
* **Closed Hand (門前):** A hand that has not made any open melds. Closed hands allow for more potential yaku.
* **Wait (待ち):** The tile or tiles that will complete your hand. Waits can be single-sided, double-sided, or multiple.
